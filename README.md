# Group Project #1 – APPetite

## Overview
    Our team (Eddie, Jules, Sam, and Tressa) conceived of and executed a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. We learned agile development methodologies and implemented features and bug fixes using the git branch workflow and pull requests.

# Motivation
    To allow users to order food based on user's current location.

# Build Status
    HTML in progress
    JavaScript in progress
    Using Materialized

# Features
    User allows Google Maps to access their location.
    User chooses a food genre.
    User chooses a restaurant.
    User chooses menu items.
    User pays for food.
    Food is delivered.

# API Reference
    Yelp
    Google Maps

## Key Topics
    * Server-side APIs
    * Git branching workflow
    * Agile software development

## Comprehension Check
    To be employer-ready, we must be able to answer the following questions:

    1. What is agile software development? 
        Agile software development comprises various approaches to software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer(s)/end user(s). It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change.

    2. What is an MVP?
        A minimum viable product (MVP) is a concept that stresses the impact of learning in new product development. Defined, an MVP, is that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort. This validated learning comes in the form of whether your customers will actually purchase your product.

        A key premise behind the idea of MVP is that you produce an actual product (which may be no more than a landing page, or a service with an appearance of automation, but which is fully manual behind the scenes) that you can offer to customers and observe their actual behavior with the product or service. Seeing what people actually do with respect to a product is much more reliable than asking people what they would do.

    3. If you pull down a teammate's branch and you have merge conflicts, how do you handle it?
        On the command line, a simple "git merge --abort" will do this for you. In case you've made a mistake while resolving a conflict and realize this only after completing the merge, you can still easily undo it: just roll back to the commit before the merge happened with "git reset --hard " and start over again.

## Learning Objectives
    You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:
    * Speak technically about a feature you implemented in your project
    * Explain and execute git branching workflow in a collaborative project
    * Resolve merge conflicts
    * Explain agile software development
    * Design, build, and deploy a client-side web application using GitHub Pages
    * Prepare a professional presentation and repository README for your project

    Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

    You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

    * Gists
    * Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
    * Files with the .md or .markdown extension
